## Contributing Rules:
### Rule 1: Issues must detail what exactly is the problem
### Rule 2: Code must be clean, meaning no excessive use of comments, and please don't make walls of code.
### Rule 3: All algorithms must be programmed in C.

## Contributing Advice:
### The more helpful an issue is, the more likely it will be fixed
### Test your code before running it
### While indentation is good, using too much is hard to read.
